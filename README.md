# FourSquareExample


This project fetches data from FourSquare Venues API(https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search) and displays the search results in a ListView. I have used standard android support libraries for UI and Gson for parsing data. AysncTasks has been used for asycnhronous operations such as getting GeoLocation of place and Fetching search data from FourSquare API. Snackbars were used for error messaging.
